Three observable trends based of the data1. The first trend that I noticed was in the scatter plot.  There are significantly more rides hailed in urban areas vs rural.  One would think there are higher fares in the city but it is actually the opposite.  Less riders in rural areas but higher fares.2. The second trend I noticed was in the first two pie charts for the percent of total fares and rides.  Visually it is quickly observed that they were relatively similar when comparing by city types.3. Lastly, unlike the first two pie charts the last pie chart is significantly different when comparing total drivers by city type.  More than 80 percent of the pie is the urban driver count.
